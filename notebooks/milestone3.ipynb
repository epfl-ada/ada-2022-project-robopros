    "Cinema made its debut in the late 19th century [1] and has become a multibillion-dollar industry, distributed over many different countries, and therefore made subject to distinct cultures and trends.\n",
    "Using the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, a collection of 42.306 movie plot summaries extracted from Wikipedia, aligned with movie and character metadata, we take a trip through time to take a look at these trends and how they have (or have not) differed across the world.\n",
    "We will analyze movies from some of the largest film industries - namely the United States, India, United Kingdom, Japan, and France [2] - from the 1950s to the 2010s.\n",
    "More specifically, we will look from two different perspectives, the movies themselves and the actors that portray them.\n",
    "This will give us an insight into whether the industry is converging due to globalization, or if each industry can keep its identity."
