Milestone 2 notebook: [notebooks/milestone2.ipynb](notebooks/milestone2.ipynb)

## Abstract

## Research questions

How do the biggest movie industries (USA, UK, France, Japan, India -> SOURCE NEEDED) compare across time?
Are they converging due to globalisation?
Do they have very distinct themes and preferences?
This project aims at finding the identity of the major movie industries and their evolution over time.

More precisely, the following research questions will be adressed:
- What trends do each of the movie industries have?
- What is the diversity in each of the industries? Has it increased over time?
- What are strong predictors of success in each of the industries?
