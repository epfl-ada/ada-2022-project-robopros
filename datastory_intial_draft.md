# Title: 

From Hollywood to Bollywood, an analysis of film industries across time (or we can change the title to: Big trends in Big five / Are movies around the world similar?)

# Main body:

## Introduction:

Cinema made its debut in the late 19th century [1] and has become a multibillion-dollar industry, distributed over many different countries, and therefore made subject to distinct cultures and trends. Using the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, a collection of 42.306 movie plot summaries extracted from Wikipedia, aligned with movie and character metadata, we take a trip through time to take a look at these trends and how they have (or have not) differed across the world.
We will analyze movies from some of the largest film industries (aka the Big Five) - namely the United States, India, United Kingdom, Japan, and France [2] - from the 1950s to the 2010s. However, many movies are combined production of more than one country. For the purpose of our analysis, we will only explore movies coming from single country. 

Our main analysis will look at differences between film industries from two perspectives, namely the movie themselves and the actors that play in them.  Regarding movies, we will use the movie.metadata.tsv dataset for metadata, and plot_summaries.txt for the summaries. Regarding actors we will use the character.metadata.tsv dataset. All datasets are extracted  form CMU Movie Summary Corpus. 

One of main questions is to decipher how the movie plots in the Big Five industries differ and evolved overtime, also if the plots overlap across different genres. Moreover, we want to see if the decade in which the movie was released, the country where is it originated, and/or rating plays any strong roles. Besides, we looked into how movie runtimes differ across the Big five overtime. 

On the other hand, we are also curious about the characters playing the leading roles in the movies. Most importantly, we want to see how diverse the characters are from different perspectives (age, gender, ethnicity, physical features). 

## Romance and Action are not the same (or some other key insights we find from the analysis)/ Are genres really different?

## Who is making the longest movies?

Even though in common knowledge it might appear that movies all over the world would be similar length. However, from our analysis it was clear that one county is definitely leading in making the longest movies. India – is not only one of the biggest countries in the world, but they are also making the longest movies. The runtimes were significantly long. The median length of Indian (aka Bollywood) movies is about 144 minutes, whereas the median length of movies from the rest of the Big Five industries is between 91 to 96 minutes. 

(Maybe add a visualizing plot here)

It is also interesting to see if the runtimes across the Big Five industries evolved over the decades. According to our analysis, in the US, the UK, and Japan there was no trend of increase or decrease in the movie runtimes over the decades. However, runtime of Indian movies has an overall downward trend overtime. On the other hand, French movies have a very slight upward trend in terms of runtime. 

(Maybe add a plot here too?)
